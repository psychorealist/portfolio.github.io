    <div class="hl4">I am a multidisciplinary artist who works primarily as an installation designer under the artist’s name ‘Giotto’. I have been working as a freelance artist for the better part of the last 8 years and I have explored many different creative fields both academically and professionally. Most of my professional work takes place in Montreal’s nightlife and rave scene by creating installations with embedded interactivity through creative coding and the creative use of projection mapping onto different surfaces and materials. This allows me to create visually compelling installations that make heavy use of materiality and the interaction between projections and materials. In the past, I had worked as a painter in a freethinking art studio. This allowed me to start my career as an artist and as a designer with an artistic incentive, an existential need to create and a drive to compel the viewers visually and emotionally.  Being multifaceted in different creative fields such as painting, creative coding, and graphic, motion, web, and installation design has allowed me to combine different mediums to create works that meet the functional and creative needs. This is especially true for when I am hired professionally to be a creative. My ability to use multiple mediums in my practice allows me to fulfill both my clients’ functional needs and my own creative needs. My ability to create with what I have and my need to create work that reflects the psyche of both myself and the viewer allows me to be a compelling hire and above all an artist.</div>
